  <h2><b>The Question</b></h2>
  <h2>In modern education, standardized tests predominate discussions of educational quality
  and accountability. Students, teachers, and schools are measured by these seemingly
  impartial markers of student achievement. But is it reasonable to use the same metric
  to evaluate all schools, even if the composition of their student populations is
  not uniform? Are there correlations between identifiable subgroups of students that
  point to trends in notions of successful schools? In this analysis we examine the
  relationship between accountability status (via School Quality Rating Policy (SQRP) scores)
  and subgroup markers including percentage of students classified for speical education
  services through, the creation of an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or a 504,
  percentage of students who qualify for Free and Reduced Lunch (FRL), and percentage of
  students who are identified and bilingual who may be provided support with English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL).
  We examined these factors in elementary and high schools.</h2>
  <h2><b>Background on SQRP Scores</b></h2>
  <h2>SQRP scores are the metric Chicago Public Schools (CPS) utilizes to compare the quality
    of schools within the district. The stated intent of these scores is to communicate to
    the community the academic success of particular schools, identify and recognize high
    achieving and high growth schools to determine best practices, provide a framework for
    goal setting, identify schools for support, and guide Board decisions. CPS
    <a href="http://cps.edu/Performance/Pages/PerformancePolicy.aspx" target="_blank">SQRP scores</a>
    are obtained from data collected the previous year. Thus, the scores accessed for
    this analysis were collected during the 2016-2017 school year. The determination of SQRP scores involves many factors which are given different
    weights. For example, the calculation for elementary schools takes into account
    student growth on the NWEA (Northwest Evaluation Association) assessment, student
    attendance, growth of priority groups, percentage of students making national
    average growth, among others. Full details on elementary and high school SQRP weighting components
    are provided below.</h2>

<h2><b>Background on Demographic Factors</b></h2>
      <h2>Our focus in this analysis is how these SQRP scores assigned to each school
        are related to student demographic markers. Specifically, we examined percent
        of students classified as special education, percent of students identified as
        bilingual, and percent of students eligible for free and reduced lunch.Do any of these markers show a
        correlation with the SQRP scores schools receive from the district? If so, what
        is the nature of that correlation and what can that tell us about other how other
        factors impact the level of the SQRP score? Because these scores have the
        potential to have a dramatic impact on enrollment in specific schools and
        public perception of the quality of neighborhood schools, the stakes are very high
        for faculty and staff.</h2>
      <h2>Students can qualify for additional services under special education policies through
        creation of an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or utilization of a 504 which refers
        to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Section 504 requires schools "provide
        free and appropriate public education for students." These classifications comprise a
        wide array of needs and designations including, but not limited to, "physically
        impaired" (PI), "cognitively impaired" (CI), "emotionally impaired" (EI), or specific
        learning disability (SLD).  Within CPS, between 13-14 percent of students have an IEP
        and 3-4 percent of students have a 504 on file. CPS recognizes the achievement gap
        between students with IEP and those without and has <a href="http://cps.edu/SiteCollectionDocuments/odlss_whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank">instituted programs</a>
        to attempt to diminish that gap.</h2>
      <h2>Bilingual classifications <a href="http://policy.cps.edu/download.aspx?ID=12" target="_blank">are also varied</a>.
        Some programs consist of a self-contained component of direct English language
        instruction. Other programs are more immersive with significant proportions of the
        school day devoted to instruction in the language spoken in the students' home.
        Once students are identified for English language support through self-reporting
        or testing, they remain in the program until it is determined they no longer require
        support, or their parents or guardians remove them from the program.</h2>
      <h2>Free and reduced lunch designation is commonly used to identify low-income students.
        While schools mostly use this demographic indicator to determine which students receive
        nutritional support, researchers will use these statistics to make assumptions about
        resources available to those students in their homes compared to those who do not
        qualify. The Federal government sets the parameters for FRL. For the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/04/10/2017-07043/child-nutrition-programs-income-eligibility-guidelines" target="_blank">2017-2018</a> school
        year, the "guidelines for free meals and milk and reduced price meals were obtained by
        multiplying the year 2017 Federal income poverty guidelines by 1.30 and 1.85, respectively,
        and by rounding the result upward to the next whole dollar." As of <a href="https://www.wbez.org/shows/wbez-news/free-lunch-for-all-in-chicago-public-schools-starts-in-september/4b6696cc-1522-4c3a-ad34-92f664d84c32" target="_blank">fall 2014</a>, CPS has
        provided all students, regardless of their qualification for FRL, with one free breakfast
        and one free lunch per day. </h2>
    <h2><b>Analytical Technique</b></h2>
      <h2>To examine the influence of these variables, we employed OLS regressions to determine the
        nature of the relationship between these demographic variables (independent variables) and
        the SQPR scores (dependent variable). An analysis of these findings is provided below, by
        school type, along with images of the regression outputs. To determine the significance of
        variable interactions we utilized t-scores and p-values at the 95 percent confidence interval.</h2>

    <h2>Schools designated as Elementary Schools are those with students in pre-K through
      8th grade. There are 473 schools that make up this subgroup within Chicago Public
      Schools. Parents in CPS have <a href="http://cps.edu/Schools/Elementary_schools/Pages/Elementaryschooltypes.aspx" target="_blank">many options</a>
      regarding where they send their students including Neighborhood, Charter, Classical,
      Contract, Magnet, Gifted, and Small. Because of all of theses parental choices, the
      rating systems for schools is a key factor in the decision-making process for parents.
      A low score could lead to reduced enrollment and repercussions for the faculty and
      staff. That is why it is essential for these scores to be accurate depictions of the
      quality of the school and not merely a reshuffling of test scores. The demographics
      of these schools need to be taken into account where these demographics could impact
      the SQRP score. </h2>
    <h2>When comparing the SQRP scores to the demographic data indicators special education
      percentage, bilingual percentage, and free and reduced lunch percentage. With regard
      to special education, there appears to be statistically significant a negative
      correlation with SQRP scores. This implies that as the proportion of students with
      special education designations--primarily those with IEPs and 504s--increases, the SQRP
      scores decrease. This impact could imply that schools with greater percentages of
      special education designated students are being impacted disproportionately by this
      scoring system. A similar trend was clear with free and reduced lunch. As the percentage
      of those students increased, the SQRP score decreased. The bilingual designation appears
      to have the opposite impact signaling a direct relationship with SQRP scores.</h2>

  <h2>High Schools serve students in 9th through 12th grades. Within the Chicago Public
    School System, there are 116 high schools. Similar to elementary school parents,
    parents of high schoolers have <a href="http://cps.edu/Schools/High_schools/Pages/Highschooltypes.aspx" target="_blank">many options</a>
    for their child's education. Often high school parents perceive the stakes as higher
    for their students to be in the best school at this level. They are looking for
    schools to best prepare their students for the next phase of their lives. This makes
    the competition intense for schools thought to be best. Thus school publicized rating
    systems, like the SQRP, can have a massive impact on the schools evaluated. </h2>
  <h2>An examination of the regression of demographic data and SQRP score assignment for
    high schools shows a similar pattern to that of elementary schools. Both special
    education and free and reduced lunch show statistically significant relationships.
    In both instances as the demographic indicator (special education and free and reduced
    lunch) increases, the SQRP score decreases. High school bilingual students also show
    a similar trend to that of elementary schools, as the percentage of bilingual students
    increases so does the SQRP score. </h2>

  <h2>By examining the data provided by CPS, we found that schools with higher percentages
    of students designated as special education or higher percentages of students who
    qualify for free or reduced lunch have a significantly lower SQRP scores. Schools with
    higher percentages of students identified as bilingual have the opposite relationship
    showing a correlation with higher SQRP scores. While these results are compelling, it
    is important to recognize that much like the SQRP scores, these relationships do not
    tell the entire story. An issue as complicated as school quality can not be distilled
    down to only a few components. And while these components all surely play a role, the
    interaction between them is not easily definable and likely differs from school to school.</h2>
  <h2>The differing effects of the demographic data may be related to school attendance rates
    among these groups. As the percentages of students designated special education or
    qualifying for FRL increases, the attendance percentage at these schools decreases.
    The opposite is true for schools with higher percentages of bilingual students. As the
    percentage of students designated bilingual increases, attendance does as well. Because
    attendance is a significant component of the SQRP calculation, this relationship is
    directly proportional. For elementary schools, it comprises 20 percent of the score,
    and for high schools, it comprises 10 percent of the score. While it is important to
    recognize that these correlations do not imply any causation, there is a logical
    component to the notion that higher attendance rates leads to increased test scores and
    by extension better ratings in the SQRP.</h2>
  <h2>While variables such as attendance and test scores are the primary factors utilized
    to compare the quality of schools within CPS, this study suggests that SQRP scores may
    not be a completely reliable metric for measuring school quality. Without considering the
    effect of demographics on scores, important intervening factors are disregarded which
    could paint an incorrect picture of a school to the community. Presently, SQRP scores
    take into account markers of student achievement that do not entirely reflect school
    environment. In order to ensure a more equitable rating system, the components should
    include factors that attempt to suitably address the demographic characteristics of the
    school.</h2>
